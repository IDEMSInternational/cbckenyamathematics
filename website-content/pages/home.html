    <h2>Supporting Grade 10 Teachers Under the CBC</h2>
    <p>The Grade 10 CBC Mathematics Project provides curriculum-aligned Open Educational Resources covering the full Grade 10 mathematics syllabus in Kenya. Resources are structured around official learning objectives and developed in accordance with the CBC curriculum framework.</p>
    <p>Teachers can access interactive and printable textbooks, lesson plans, teacher guides, and certified professional development courses that support continuous professional growth.</p>
    <p>While the current focus is Grade 10, the project is designed to expand to additional grades over time. All materials are openly licensed and developed through collaboration between Kenyan mathematics educators and institutions, enabling ongoing refinement and shared ownership.</p>
    <p><strong>These resources are organised into three complementary strands:</strong></p>
