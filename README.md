# CBC Kenya Mathematics

A free, interactive textbook and resource hub for Grade 10 CBC Mathematics. This project provides interactive lessons, exercises, lesson plans, guides, and training courses supporting Kenya's Competency-Based Curriculum.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### View the Website

Visit: [https://smbor.github.io/cbckenyamathematics/](https://smbor.github.io/cbckenyamathematics/) *(or your deployed URL)*

### Local Development

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the local server:
   ```powershell
   node scripts/website-serve.js
   ```
4. The site opens automatically at http://localhost:8080

**Note:** The site uses `fetch()` for dynamic content loading, so a web server is required (opening `index.html` directly won't work).

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for full setup instructions including Google Sheets sync.

## 🔄 Updating Lesson Plans

The lesson plans catalog is automatically synced from Google Sheets. See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for full setup instructions.

**Quick version (after first-time setup):**
```powershell
node scripts/website-build.js
```
This pulls the latest data from Google Sheets and regenerates the website catalog in one step.
