# CBC Kenya Mathematics

A free, interactive textbook and resource hub for CBC Mathematics Grade 10, published by the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development. This project provides interactive lessons, exercises, lesson plans, guides, and training courses supporting Kenya's Competency-Based Curriculum.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### View the Website

Visit: [https://smbor.github.io/cbckenyamathematics/](https://smbor.github.io/cbckenyamathematics/) *(or your deployed URL)*

### Local Development

1. Clone this repository
2. Install a local web server:
   ```bash
   npm install -g http-server
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```bash

## 🔄 Updating Lesson Plans

The lesson plans catalog is automatically generated from CSV files. See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for detailed instructions.

**Quick version:**
1. Export CSVs from Google Sheets
2. Run: `node scripts/csv-to-lesson-plans-json.js`
3. The script generates `website-content/data/lesson-plans-catalog.json`

**Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development** | **Competency-Based Curriculum**

- **Home page content**: [website-content/pages/home.html](website-content/pages/home.html)
- **About page**: [website-content/pages/about.html](website-content/pages/about.html)
- **Resources page**: [website-content/pages/resources.html](website-content/pages/resources.html)

### 2) Where to edit design (look & feel)

- **Global styles (colors, spacing, typography)**: [website-content/css/styles.css](website-content/css/styles.css)
- **Navigation styles (top menu)**: [website-content/css/navigation.css](website-content/css/navigation.css)
- **Navigation behavior (mobile menu)**: [website-content/js/navigation.js](website-content/js/navigation.js)

### 3) Add or change images

1. Put image files in [website-content/images/](website-content/images/).
2. Use **this path format** in `home.html`:
	- `website-content/images/...`
3. For `about.html` and `resources.html`, you can use normal relative paths like:
	- `../images/...`

### 4) Preview your changes locally

The homepage loads content with `fetch()`, so you **must** use a local web server (opening `index.html` directly won’t work).

#### Step A — Install the preview server (once)

```bash
npm install -g http-server
```

**Windows PowerShell note (if you get an execution policy error):**

```bash
& "C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.cmd" install -g http-server
```

#### Step B — Start the server (every time you want to preview)

```bash
http-server -p 8000
```

**Windows PowerShell note (if the run step fails):**

```bash
& "$env:APPDATA\npm\http-server.cmd" -p 8000
```

#### Step C — Open the site in your browser

Open: http://localhost:8000/

### 5) If you don’t see changes

- Press **Ctrl + F5** (hard refresh).
- If images don’t load, double‑check the file path in the HTML.

## Lesson Plans Data Pipeline

### What This Is For

The lesson plans catalog on the website is generated from two CSV files that are exported from Google Sheets. This pipeline converts those CSV files into a structured JSON file that the website reads and displays.

**The two CSV files contain:**
- **book-structure.csv** — The lesson plan metadata (chapter names, sections, learning objectives, status flags)
- **file-matching.csv** — The actual file paths for lesson plans and guides, plus whether they exist

**The output is:**
- **lesson-plans-catalog.json** — A structured catalog that the website uses to display all lesson plans in a hierarchical format

### How to Update the Lesson Plans Catalog

#### Prerequisites

You need Node.js installed on your computer. Check if you have it:

```bash
node --version
```

If you don't see a version number, [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

#### Step 1: Export the Latest Data from Google Sheets

1. Open the "Book and Lesson Plan Structure" Google Sheet
2. Go to **File → Download → Comma Separated Values (.csv)**
3. Export the **"New Book Structure"** tab and save it as `book-structure.csv`
4. Export the **"File Matching"** tab and save it as `file-matching.csv`
5. Place both files in the `website-content/data/` folder (replacing the old ones)

#### Step 2: Run the Conversion Script

Open a terminal/command prompt in the project folder and run:

```bash
node scripts/csv-to-lesson-plans-json.js
```

**Windows PowerShell alternative:**

```powershell
node .\scripts\csv-to-lesson-plans-json.js
```

#### Step 3: Verify the Output

You should see output like:
```
Successfully parsed 130 rows from book-structure.csv
Successfully parsed 130 rows from file-matching.csv
Successfully generated lesson-plans-catalog.json with X chapters
```

The script creates/updates `website-content/data/lesson-plans-catalog.json`.

### JSON Structure Explained

The generated catalog follows this hierarchical structure:

```json
{
  "baseUrl": "https://innodems.github.io/CBC-Grade-10-Maths/external/lesson_plans/",
  "chapters": [
    {
      "id": "numbers-and-algebra",
      "title": "Numbers and Algebra",
      "sections": [
        {
          "id": "classification-of-numbers",
          "title": "Classification of Numbers",
          "learningObjectives": [
            "Objective 1 text...",
            "Objective 2 text..."
          ],
          "subsections": [
            {
              "id": "natural-numbers",
              "title": "Natural Numbers",
              "hasSubtopics": true,
              "topics": [
                {
                  "id": "introduction-to-natural-numbers",
                  "title": "Introduction to Natural Numbers",
                  "lessonPlan": {
                    "path": "Numbers and Algebra/Classification of Natural Numbers/Natural Numbers/Introduction to Natural Numbers - LP.pdf",
                    "exists": true
                  },
                  "guide": {
                    "path": "Numbers and Algebra/.../Guide.pdf",
                    "exists": false
                  },
                  "learningObjectiveRefs": [0, 1]
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Key Structure Features:

1. **Conditional Nesting**: Subsections can be structured in two ways:
   - **With subtopics** (`hasSubtopics: true`): Contains a `topics` array with multiple lesson plans
   - **Without subtopics** (`hasSubtopics: false`): Contains `lessonPlan` and `guide` properties directly

2. **Learning Objectives**: Stored at the section level to avoid duplication. Topics reference them using `learningObjectiveRefs` (array of indices).

3. **File Paths**: All paths are relative to `baseUrl`. The website combines them to create full URLs.

4. **Existence Flags**: The `exists` boolean indicates whether the PDF file is actually available (used to show "Coming Soon" messages).

5. **IDs**: All chapters, sections, subsections, and topics have URL-safe IDs (lowercase, hyphens instead of spaces).

### Troubleshooting

**"Cannot find module" error:**
- Make sure you're running the command from the project root folder (where `scripts/` is visible)

**"No such file or directory" error:**
- Check that both CSV files exist in `website-content/data/`
- Check that the filenames are exactly `book-structure.csv` and `file-matching.csv`

**Empty or incorrect JSON output:**
- Open the CSV files and verify they have the expected column headers
- Make sure there are no extra blank lines at the top of the CSV files
- Check that the CSV exports didn't change the column structure
